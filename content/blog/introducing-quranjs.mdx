I'm excited to introduce [QuranJS][quranjs] to the JS community. [QuranJS][quranjs] is an opensource organization foucused on building tools in the JS ecosystem to make it easier for people to build Quarn related prouducts.

I've been lately working on Quran related prouducts, and I noticed that a lot of the code is actually being repeated in most of the projects. So, I decided to create a tool to facilitate the process of creating a new Quran related project. The first package is already out, [`@quranjs/api`][quranjs/api], which is a library that provides a simple SDK to interact with the [Quran.com API][quran.com/api]. There are more packages coming soon like `@quranjs/react` (which will provide UI utils for rendering the Holy Quran) and `@quranjs/json` (which will contain all Quran data offline as json).

That's it! I hope you enjoy the tool and find it useful. For contributing, [go here][quranjs].
